 Have you ever worn clothes and have been like, ‚Äúman, I want everyone to see my fit‚Äù. I have not. But I have had wanted to show the world my [insert common object]. Introducing Thingathon, the random object social media app the world needs. Every day, an object is randomly selected from the Thingathon servers that you have 24 hours to take a photo of. After taking the photo, you can see other people‚Äôs photos of the thing. </div>

## MVP üèÜ
